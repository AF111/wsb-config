# What is this?

I found myself having to manually edit `.wsb` config files a lot which are in XML format. WSB-config is a simple web-based config editor for windows Sandbox. Windows Sandbox is a lightweight desktop environment to run applications in isolation.

Initially, I wanted to make a sort of a simple launcher to organize all your configs and launch from one place. However, that would not be possible on the web for obvious reasons and, It's too small of a tool to entice me enough to go with native windows desktop apps at the moment.

Windows Sandbox supports simple XML formatted configuration files with a `.wsb` file extension that provide a minimal set of customization parameters for the Sandbox. Windows 10 build 18342 or Windows 11 is required to use this feature.
